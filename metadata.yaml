description: "Sybil, or The Two Nations is an 1845 novel by Benjamin Disraeli. Published\
  \ in the same year as Friedrich Engels's The Condition of the Working Class in England\
  \ in 1844, Sybil traces the plight of the working classes of England. Disraeli was\
  \ interested in dealing with the horrific conditions in which the majority of England's\
  \ working classes lived — or, what is generally called the Condition of England\
  \ question.\nThe book is a roman à thèse, or a novel with a thesis — which was meant\
  \ to create a furor over the squalor that was plaguing England's working class cities.\n\
  Disraeli's novel was made into a silent film called Sybil in 1921, starring Evelyn\
  \ Brent and Cowley Wright.\nDisraeli's interest in this subject stemmed from his\
  \ interest in the Chartist movement, a working-class political reformist movement\
  \ that sought universal male suffrage and other parliamentary reforms. (Thomas Carlyle\
  \ sums up the movement in his 1839 book \"Chartism.\") Chartism failed as a parliamentary\
  \ movement (three petitions to Parliament were rejected); however, five of the \"\
  Six Points\" of Chartism would become a reality within a century of the group's\
  \ formation.\nChartism demanded:\nUniversal suffrage for men\nSecret Ballot\nRemoval\
  \ of property requirements for Parliament\nSalaries for Members of Parliament (MPs)\n\
  Equal Electoral districts\nAnnually elected Parliament\n\n\n From Wikipedia (CC\
